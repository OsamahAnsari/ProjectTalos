## Background

This repository contains the website code for the **[Project Talos](https://projecttalos.com/)** website. This website served to document and showcase the weekly progress on my research project during EECS 499. The final resulting game's repo can be found at **[ML Hummingbirds](https://github.com/OsamahAnsari/ML-Hummingbirds)**.  

> Project Talos is a research project into the application of machine learning in game development. Machine learning within the game development industry has had a stigma attached   to it for being unpredictable and overly difficult to implement. However, with recent advancements in machine learning and the release of Unityâ€™s ML Agents package, machine       learning could finally find a place in the game development scene. This project seeks to explore the process of developing a simple game using machine learning agents and         document the process along the way.
