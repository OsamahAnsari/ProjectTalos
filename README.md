## Background

This repository contains the website code for the **[Project Talos](https://projecttalos.com/)** website. This website served to document and showcase the weekly progress on my research project during EECS 499. The final resulting game's repo can be found at **[ML Hummingbirds](https://github.com/OsamahAnsari/ML-Hummingbirds)**.


## Credits

The credits for this website's theme go to Mark Otto (https://github.com/mdo) and Andrew Park (https://github.com/andrewhwanpark). 
 - Mark Otto (https://github.com/mdo) designed the original Poole Jekyll theme. 
 - The Dark Poole theme was created by Andrew Park (https://github.com/andrewhwanpark) by taking Otto's theme and giving it a dark aesthetic.
 - I finally took the Dark Poole theme and modified it to fit the theme I wanted for my project.
