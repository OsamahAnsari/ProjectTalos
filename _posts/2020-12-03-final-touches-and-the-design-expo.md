This week I put the finishing touches on my ML Agents game, **The Flower's Nightmare:** Attack of the Hummingbots, and prepared for the [Fall 2020 CoE Design Expo](https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/mdp_events/design-expo/) at the University of Michigan. I also plan to document the journey this project followed and leave a guide for exploring machine learning agents in game development for anyone who looks into this topic in the future.
