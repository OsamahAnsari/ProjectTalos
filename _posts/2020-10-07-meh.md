title: Week 5 - Idk Yet
---

The fifth week of research involved finishing up the ML-Agents Hummingbirds training. 

## ML-Agents Hummingbird Training Results

The ML-Agent has made significant progress by the end of its training session which took a total of about 6 hours to complete. However, I was training using CPU only, so the required time could be significantly shorter. But before I show you the end results, I feel it fitting to remind you of how the Hummingbird was performing early on in its training.

### Where We Began

First hour and a half of training:

The Hummingbird just aimlessly flies pondering its existence.

After about two hours of training:

The Hummingbird has discovered nectar and realized it is the drink of the gods. Still not very good at getting to it though, yet.

A quick graph of the first two hours of training:

Look at that rapid growth! I knew he had it in him!

### How Far We've Come

Now it's about time I show you the fully trained agent. Here is an uninterrupted full minute of its nectar collecting spree:

Look at him go! They grow up so fast. 

In all seriousness, the Hummingbird agent has significantly improved by the end of the training session, after 5 million steps, than where it was 2 hours in, at approx. 1.5 million steps. Although it isn't perfect, it generally has no issue getting its beak into the flower and staying long enough to collect the nectar before moving on the next flower. 

Now let's check out the graph of its progress throughout the training session.

From this we can see the Hummingbird agent started off very slow, not making any significant progress for the first approx. 1 million to 1.2 million steps (~1 hour). I assume this slow progress can be accounted for by the Hummingbird not accidently stumbling into some nectar. However, once the agent discovered nectar, it made progress more significantly faster. The agent went from getting an average of 0 flowers at 1 million steps to an average of 34.26 flowers at 2 million steps. After about 2.5 million to 3 million steps, the agent's progress started to level off. At this point the agent averaged anywhere from just under 25 flowers on the low end to just over 50 flowers on the high end. Generally, it got about 38 flowers worth of nectar a run. However, this large disparity in average nectar collected can be attributed to the random spawn position of the Hummingbird agent at the start of any given run. 

## Next Week's Plan

Next week, I plan on returning with the results of many more hours of training and the completed environment where the player can compete against the ML-Agent. I also plan on going back and fixing up the ML-Agent Penguins just so I can experiment with it a bit more. Finally, I plan on diving into the UnityVGDL Framework.

Thanks for reading! Make sure to check back next week!
