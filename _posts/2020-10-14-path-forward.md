title: Week 6 - Path Forward
---

After wrapping up last week's fun and interesting ML-Agents project, I struggled to find an avenue forward toward the future. Basically, it was hard to get anything "deliverable" done this week. Between juggling EECS 482 Project 2, EECS 493, and this class and the mental deadlock I hit at the end of last week, I didn't really know where to go. It didn't help that the stakeholders I reached out to essentially called machine learning in Game Development a pipe dream, for the foreseeable future. Both of them argued that machine learning is too much of a hassle in complex games and it is not efficient enough to be useful for testing yet. They said maybe machine learning would be more useful in the future when machine learning algorithms improve and cloud computing allows ML agents to train significantly faster regardless of a user's hardware. I started this week's research by looking more into possible future approaches for machine learning in game development.

## Research into Possible Future Avenues (8-9 hours)

The majority of this week was spent researching and trying to think up ways to make something relevant for game developers or the video game industry involving machine learning. I started by researching articles and YouTube videos as research papers were far more academic than practical for real life situations. I went through a lot of sites, but I thought I would highlight some of the more noteworthy ones I found below. 

### Google's Machine Learning Suite

While searching the web I came across Google's [Machine Learning for Game Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h-Wg5FDbtU) rresentation at Google I/O'19. The half an hour long talk covered how Google has created a suite of machine learning APIs to make game development easier. They discussed machine learning APIs that can allow dynamic chat translation between languages, chat intention detection systems for handling inappropriate messages automatically, auto object detection in images and videos, and Auto ML and Cloud AI platform. The Auto ML and Cloud AI services allow a game developer to pass in data collected from their game to pass to Google's servers to train a custom machine learning model for their game and allow easy deployment of it worldwide. This service would allow game developers with no knowledge of machine learning to train advanced models for set purposes within their game.

Watching the video just further cemented my opinion of how insane Google is. Although I could never work toward implementing anything similar, it did however get the mental juices flowing for how to go about incorporating machine learning into games.

### Ubisoft and Machine Learning

After some more digging, I came across an article discussing how Ubisoft took significant steps towards incorporating machine learning into game development within their company. According to the article, [How Ubisoft Is Mainstreaming Machine Learning Into Game Development](https://analyticsindiamag.com/how-ubisoft-is-mainstreaming-machine-learning-into-game-development/), Ubisoft incorporated a machine learning algorithm into Assassin's Creed Origins to dynamically recognize hieroglyphics in ancient Eyptian sources (they used these as references while creating the game). The machine learning model then identifies hieroglyphs and uses completed translations to translate previously untranslated patterns of hieroglyphs. Ubisoft also partnered with Firefox to create [Commit Assistant](https://www.kitguru.net/channel/generaltech/matthew-wilson/ubisoft-is-using-machine-learning-to-spot-bugs-before-they-make-it-into-the-final-game-code/), a machine learning program that can catch bugs in developer code. The model trained on 10 years worth of old Ubisoft developer code to learn what types of statements will cause bugs and how they can be fixed. Using this information the model can predict with 60% accuracy (2018) lines that will cause bugs and suggest potential fixes.

This one wasn't super helpful for coming up with feasible projects, but I thought it was really cool so I thought I'd share it.
