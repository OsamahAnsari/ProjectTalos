title: Week 12 - Final Touches and Design Expo Prep
---

This week I put the finishing touches on my ML Agents game, **The Flower's Nightmare:** Attack of the Hummingbots, and prepared for the [Fall 2020 CoE Design Expo](https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/mdp_events/design-expo/) at the University of Michigan. 

## The Flower's Nightmare: Attack of the Hummingbots

Here is a quick run-down of the changes I made this week:
- Implemented fully functioning main menu
- Implemented a full tutorial level
- Reworked the game level to account for the new scenes
- Polished up movement and setup for movement animations
- Tried adding movement animations but decided to temporarily disable them
- Added music for the main menu and the game itself that kinda fits with the theme
- Tried tuning the hummingbirds some more
- Fixed other miscellaneous bugs

I plan to continue to work on this later today and make the final adjustments.

## Preparation for The CoE Design Expo 

I also prepared some slides for the CoE Design Expo. The intent of the slides is to show my journey in making an ML Agent game and to outline the key problems I faced along the way. I describe the solutions I found in the hopes that future game designers who try to make their own ML Agents game don't struggle as much with the same problems.

You can view the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zl-6EEp7SOEROw0jPdHHJ6FFgav-9bWAdp_aZMvI5_o/edit?usp=sharing).

## Plans Post-Design Expo

After the design expo, I plan on posting one final devlog where I document the journey this project followed and leave a guide for anyone who looks into this topic in the future. I'll cover general tips for incorporating, training, and advancing ML Agents in Unity games. Finally, I plan on discussing some possible avenues for future research for any other students who stumble onto this project in the future. So be sure to check back as that will most likely be the last devlog of this project.
