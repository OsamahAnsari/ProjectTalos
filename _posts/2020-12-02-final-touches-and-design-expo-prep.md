This week I put the finishing touches on my ML Agents game, **The Flower's Nightmare:** Attack of the Hummingbots, and prepared for the [Fall 2020 CoE Design Expo](https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/mdp_events/design-expo/) at the University of Michigan.

## Plans Post-Design Expo

After the design expo, I plan on posting one final devlog where I document the journey this project followed and leave a guide for anyone who looks into this topic in the future. I'll cover general tips for incorporating, training, and advancing ML Agents in Unity games. Finally, I plan on discussing some possible avenues for future research for any other students who stumble onto this project in the future. So be sure to check back as that will most likely be the last devlog of this project.
