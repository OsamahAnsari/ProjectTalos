## Market Research



## Stakeholder Research

The main benefit of my research will be to game development companies. Since a general video game AI would be able to playtest "any" video game, it would be greatly useful to development companies as it could save time and money on playtesting. It would be especially useful to smaller game development companies as they lack the resources to support a big playtesting team. Therefore, such an AI would allow them to build bigger and more complex games. As such, the cost of producing such an AI should be close to the lower end if possible.

This type of research could also benefit companies seeking general intelligent agents that can perform a myriad of tasks. Assuming it is possible to build an AI that can play any videogame without prior knowledge of it, how much further could you take it? Could they be taught to do everything under the sun?


That is all for this week, thanks for reading!
