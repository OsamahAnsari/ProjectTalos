Our interest in artifical intelligence long predates modern technology, originating in literature as far back as ancient Greece. The earliest notions of artifically intelligent creatures came from works of Greek poets Hesiod and Homer. The earliest of said stories being that of the automaton **Talos, the giant bronze man**. It was said that Talos was created by the god Hephaestus to guard the island of Crete from invaders.[^fn-talos_footnote]

## What is Project Talos?

Project Talos is a research project into machine learning and artificial intelligence and their possible impacts on game development. I currently do not know where I want to go specifically within these fields, but hopefully as I do more research I can narrow down the scope of the project to something more concise. 

I will be recording weekly devlogs, so make sure to check back for future updates.

Thanks!
