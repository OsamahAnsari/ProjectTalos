The third week of the research was pretty relaxed compared to last week. This week I reached out to a some stakeholders and began experimenting with the [General Video Game AI Framework](https://github.com/GAIGResearch/GVGAI).

## Small Update on Contacting Stakeholders

On Thursday, September 23, 2020, I reached out to eight different possible stakeholders from either the video game development industry or the artificial intelligence industry. I am happy to say I got a response back for three of them. Depending on how my research goes in the next two weeks, I might reach out to a few additional possible stakeholders in the upcoming weeks.

## The General Video Game Framework





## Unity ML-Agents
